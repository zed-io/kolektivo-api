# Blockchain API Service

## Setup

You should only use this method if your `yarn install` fails to issues related to `sqlite3` and `python` via the underlying `node-gyp` build tool. If you are using Mac M1 and have Python3 installed by default, the SQLite3 dependency may fail to install. Ensure that `npm` uses python3 by doing the following.

```sh
export npm_config_python=$(where python3)
```

And verify by running `npm config list`, running this command should show output resembling the following, using the path for where python3 is installed on your machine.

```sh
; "env" config from environment

python = "/usr/bin/python3" 
```

Install dependencies:

```sh
yarn
```

Build (must run first or tests will not pass!):

```sh
yarn build
```

## Testing

Unit tests, linting, and formatting:

```sh
yarn test
```

End-to-end tests:

```sh
yarn e2e
```

## Running locally

You can run with the [Firebase emulator](#emulator) or a real
[Firebase account](#account). Copy the corresponding example config
file.

For the emulator:

```sh
# Check if there are any values you need to complete
cp emuluator.env .env
```

or for the account:

```sh
# Check if there are any values you need to complete
cp example.env .env
```

After completing your `.env`, build and start:

```sh
yarn start:dev  # Uses tsc-watch to watch the folder and rebuild as needed
```

### Docker Compose

Docker offers us a way to simply set up our local environment, so we can run the service with a implementation for every external dependency.
The `docker-compose.yml` contains all the configuration.
To run it, install docker from: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/
Then, you should be able to run `docker-compose up` in the root of the repo and it will set up all the dependencies.

To see active docker containers, you can run `docker ps`

To enter in a container, you can run `docker exec -it ${CONTAINER_ID} /bin/bash`

#### Postgres

If you want to take a look at postgres db, access to the container with the command of above, and then `psql -U postgres`

## Firebase

### Emulator

Start the emulator before running blockchain-api:

```sh
yarn firebase:emulate
```

### Account

You also need a service account for the Firebase connection. You can create one from the GCP IAM console following these steps (ignore all except the last one if you already have one):

- Open the GCP console.
- Go to `IAM & Admin`
- Choose `Service Accounts` from the side menu
- Pick a name such as `Development Service Account for FirstName LastName` and press `Continue`
- Assign the role `Firebase Admin`
- Press `Done`
- Search for the newly created service account in the list and press on its 'email' column to open it.
- Go to the `Keys` tab.
- `Add key` -> `Create new key` -> `JSON` -> `Create`
- You will be prompted to download the service account key. Rename it to `serviceAccountKey.json` and put it in the root of the repo.

## Deploying to App Engine

```sh
./deploy.sh -n {alfajores,mainnet}
```
